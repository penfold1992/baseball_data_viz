# Data Analytics Nanodegree: Data Visualization
# Make Effective Data Visualization
## Summary
The dataset contains data on *handedness*, *height*, *weight*, *batting average* and *Home Runs*.  
My analysis looks at the potential connection between weight and batting statistics (average and Home Runs).  
The visualization utilizes d3 to provide a martini-glass narrative structure.

## Design
I have utilized a simple scatter plot to display the data.  
I bucketed the data into bins of width 5 in order to get some good metrics to visualize the quantity of data.  
I was unable to use the nested function because I needed to aggregate within the bins. So I wrote an 
aggregation function myself.

I utilized the Bootstrap library to get some clean buttons that are easy to implement.
